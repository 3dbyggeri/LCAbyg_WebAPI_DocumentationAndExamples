# LCAbyg_WebAPI_DocumentationAndExamples
Repo for collecting the documentation and examples for the Danish software LCAbyg's WebAPI

# Quick Start guide

1. Register on https://api.lcabyg.dk/da/
2. Upon successful registration, you should use the same account username and password in the Login API (you can find it in the postman collection above) request (just replace values in the body). That access token can be then used for authentication for every other API call in the collection.
3. Don't forget to download the example files (python & json files) from the official website. (the same one where you registered) You must be logged in to see that option!
